_This is not yet complete and will have more updates for 2025._

The following rubrics break out the assessment by different areas. 

### <a name='Functionality50'></a>Functionality (50%)

| **Criteria**               | **Exemplary (100%)** | **Satisfactory (80%)** | **Not Yet (60%)** | **Unassessable (0%)** |
|---------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Quality (Bugs)** | No major bugs or glitches. Program does not crash. All basic use cases work as advertised. Only minor bugs present. | Few major bugs. Program does not crash. Behavior is mostly correct. | Some major bugs. Program seldom crashes. | Major bugs prevalent. Important behavior malfunctions. |
| **Polish/User Design** | Appearance is clean and professional. No visual or audio bugs. Great attention to detail and creativity. | Appearance is mostly well-organized and neat. No usage issues. | Appearance is somewhat organized. Usage is somewhat difficult. | Appearance is poor. Usage is difficult. |
| **Quantity (Features)** | Completed all MVP features and then some. Code demonstrates many hours of focused work (6+ hours per week). | Completed all MVP features. Appropriate number of hours is evident (5 hrs/week). | Completed some MVP features. Shows a lack of effort and dedication (3-4 hrs/week). | A long way from appropriate effort and completion. |
| **Difficulty** | Difficult technology, algorithms, UI, and/or library integration. | Appropriate difficulty. | Lack of apparent or significant learning. | No demonstration of learning. |
| **Data Structures** | Appropriate in all cases. | Mostly good. | Some poor choices. | Poor choices abound. |
| **Class Design** | Strong use of all: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism. | Use of inheritance and encapsulation is good. Reasonable set of classes. | Classes used, but not encapsulated well. Over or under-designed. | Few classes. Bad design. |

### <a name='DocumentationUnitTests30'></a>Documentation/Unit Tests (30%)

| **Criteria**               | **Exemplary (100%)** | **Satisfactory (80%)** | **Not Yet (60%)** | **Unassessable (0%)** |
|---------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Specification** | All sections are complete, professional, and add value. | All sections are complete, effort is clear. Meets all expectations of a high school developer. | All sections are attempted, yet more effort desired. | Missing sections and/or effort is lacking. |
| **Task Worksheet** | All sections are professional and add value. Tasks updated daily and closely reflect reality. | All sections are complete with believable data in a timely manner. Effort is clear. | All sections are complete, but perhaps not timely. Some areas lack sufficient thought and/or effort, or appear to be made up. | Missing sections and/or effort is insufficient. |
| **Unit Tests (upon request)** | JUnit (or some professional testing infrastructure) is used to test many methods. | Some code is written that performs testing of important pieces of functionality beyond running the program normally. | The code has remnants of unit testing. | No artifacts of testing present. |

### <a name='Professionalism20'></a>Professionalism (20%)

| **Criteria**               | **Exemplary (100%)** | **Satisfactory (80%)** | **Not Yet (60%)** | **Unassessable (0%)** |
|---------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Demo Days** | Clear achievements made during each demo. Shared learning along with functionality. Worksheet is complete. | Some progress is demonstrated. Worksheet has some updates. | Progress is missing or too small. Worksheet is missing important information. | No progress is discernible. Worksheet is inadequate. |
| **Formal Presentation** | Thorough presentation of project: functionality, learnings, and experience. Professional slides and/or presentation. | Demonstrates functionality and some insight into the development experience. No slides necessary. Reasonable quality of presentation. | Falls short of sharing functionality or experience. Presentation lacks quantity or quality. | Missing or woefully disorganized, lacking details. |
| **Independence** | No instances of being off task. Asks for hints occasionally, independently researches, demonstrates problem-solving abilities. | 1 or 2 reminders needed to be on task. Needs help with difficult issues but demonstrates ability to debug and grow independently. | 3+ reminders to get back on task. Consistently unable to resolve (minor) issues without assistance. | Frequently off task. Cannot make progress without assistance. |
