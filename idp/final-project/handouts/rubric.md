# IDP Final Project Rubric

## Discovery Document

Below is the grading rubric for the Discovery Document, structured with three performance levels: "Exceeds Expectations," "Meets Expectations," and "Does Not Meet Expectations." Each main requirement is assigned a maximum point value, totaling 100 points.
